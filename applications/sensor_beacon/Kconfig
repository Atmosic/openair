config SENSOR_BEACON_UPDATE_INTERVAL
	int "Sensor data update interval in centiseconds"
	default 100
	help
	  Interval between sensor data updates and beacon advertisement updates.
	  Value is in centiseconds (1 centisecond = 10ms).
	  Default is 100 centiseconds = 1 second for responsive debugging.

config SENSOR_BEACON_FAST_ADV
	bool "Fast advertising mode"
	default n
	help
	  Enable fast advertising mode for quick device discovery.
	  Fast mode: 100-150ms intervals (higher power, better responsiveness)
	  Normal mode: 1-1.2s intervals (balanced power and responsiveness)

	  Fast mode is recommended for applications requiring immediate discovery,
	  while normal mode provides good balance for most use cases.

config SENSOR_BEACON_ACCEL_SCALING_FACTOR
	int "Accelerometer scaling factor"
	default 16000
	help
	  Scaling factor to convert Zephyr sensor values to match the
	  mobile app expectations. Set to 16000 to compensate for mobile
	  app scaling (÷16÷1000) with ±16g range for optimal sensitivity.

config SENSOR_BEACON_TEMP_SCALING_FACTOR
	int "Temperature scaling factor"
	default 256
	help
	  Scaling factor for temperature values using fixed-point with 256 scale factor.

config SENSOR_BEACON_HUMIDITY_SCALING_FACTOR
	int "Humidity scaling factor"
	default 256
	help
	  Scaling factor for humidity values using fixed-point with 256 scale factor.

config SENSOR_BEACON_BUTTON_POWER_CONTROL
	bool "Button-controlled power management"
	help
	  Enable button-controlled device power management functionality.
	  When enabled, this mode provides:
	  - Device starts in OFF state and requires button activation
	  - Device ON/OFF control via 2-second button press
	  - Power state LED indications (Green LED for ON, Red LED for OFF)
	  - Device state management with low power mode support

	  When disabled (default), the device operates in immediate beaconing mode:
	  - Device starts beaconing immediately after power on
	  - No device ON/OFF functionality via button
	  - Only beacon status LED indication is active

config SENSOR_BEACON_WURX_ACTIVE_ADV_TIME_MS
	int "WURX active advertising time in milliseconds"
	depends on WURX
	default 60000
	help
	  Duration in milliseconds for active advertising period before entering
	  hibernation when WURX mode is enabled. During this time, the device
	  advertises normally to allow discovery. After this period expires,
	  the device enters hibernation and waits for WURX wake-up signals.
	  Default is 60000 ms (60 seconds).
