Overview
********

This sample illustrates the functionality of a combo tag compatible with both **Apple Find My Network** and **Samsung SmartThings Find Network**.

Requirements
************

- Atmosic EVK <:ref:`board | serial <atmosic_evk>`>

  .. note::

   Currently, only the **ATM33/e** and **ATM34/e** series of Atmosic devices are supported.

Samsung SmartThings Find Device SDK
***********************************

1. Once you have access to SmartThings Find Device SDK you can request for the integration patch from Atmosic.

2. Create a directory named ``vendor`` under the ``<WEST_TOPDIR>``, and place the unzipped ``TagSDK`` directory under ``vendor``. The path will be ``<WEST_TOPDIR>/vendor/TagSDK``.
