Atmosic Settings Subsystem (ATM_SETTINGS)
#########################################

The Atmosic Settings Subsystem (ATM_SETTINGS) integrates the Zephyr settings
subsystem to enhance flexibility and compatibility, and supports Factory data
and Settings storage for applications to use according to specifications or
requirements.

The ATM_SETTINGS includes several Zephyr settings configuration options and
invokes Zephyr's settings APIs. Therefore, when Zephyr settings subsystem is
upgraded, ATM_SETTINGS is also upgraded accordingly to stay in sync.

The main purpose of ATM_SETTINGS is to extend the initialization capabilities of
the Zephyr settings subsystem. The standard settings initialization in Zephyr
only supports the settings storage partition. With the ATM_SETTINGS, an
additional read-only factory data partition is also initialized.

However, access to these partitions is still performed through the standard
Zephyr settings APIs.

    For detailed information about the Zephyr settings subsystem, please refer
    to the official Zephyr documentation at
    `Zephyr Settings Subsystem <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/storage/settings/index.html>`_.

ATM_SETTINGS Configuration
***************************

The application uses the ATM_SETTINGS configuration to initialize the Zephyr
settings subsystem, allowing access to the settings storage and factory data
located in the flash partitions defined in the devicetree.

.. note::

    The files related to ATM_SETTINGS are located in the openair\\subsys\\settings directory.

The CONFIG_ATM_SETTINGS configuration defined in Kconfig to enable the
ATM_SETTINGS feature, which depends on the CONFIG_SETTINGS configuration.

**File:** `openair\\subsys\\settings\\Kconfig`

.. code-block:: bash

    config ATM_SETTINGS
    	bool "Proprietary settings subsystem library"
    	depends on SETTINGS

The CONFIG_ATM_SETTINGS configuration option adds the atm_settings include
directory and atm_settings source code to Zephyr's build system.

Configuring the CONFIG_SETTINGS and CONFIG_ATM_SETTINGS options in the project
configuration file will activate the Zephyr settings subsystem and the related
ATM_SETTINGS functions.

**File:** `prj.conf`

.. code-block:: bash

    CONFIG_SETTINGS=y
    CONFIG_ATM_SETTINGS=y

ATM_SETTINGS Initialization
***************************

The ATM_SETTINGS provides several functions, which are described below. However,
users only need to focus on the ``atm_settings_init()`` function for
initializing ATM_SETTINGS. The ATM_SETTINGS initialization is designed to mount
and start up the settings storage and factory data within the Zephyr settings
subsystem.

- ``atm_settings_init()`` initializes the settings subsystem based on the settings storage partition and factory data partition defined in the device tree.
- ``atm_settings_subsys_init()`` provides proprietary settings subsystem initialization that allows for more flexibility in configuring the settings subsystem instead of settings storage partition only.
- ``atm_settings_factory_partition_info_get()`` gets the factory partition information defined in the device tree.
- ``atm_get_device_partition_info()`` gets the specified partition information defined in the device tree based on the partition ID.
- ``atm_settings_backend_init()`` initializes the settings subsystem backends based on the specified settings configuration information instead of settings storage partition.

ATM_SETTINGS Factory Data Write Protection
******************************************

To prevent the factory data from being unexpectedly modified, it is set to
read-only during ATM_SETTINGS initialization. Additionally, hardware-level write
protection is applied during system startup.

ATM_SETTINGS Sample
*******************

The :ref:`ATM_SETTINGS sample <atm_settings-sample>` demonstrates how to use the
ATM_SETTINGS and the Zephyr settings subsystem related functions to access
factory data and settings storage. Some of the Zephyr APIs used in the
ATM_SETTINGS sample are shown below.
