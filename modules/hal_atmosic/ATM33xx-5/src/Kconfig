	  Maximum duration to remain in SOC off state, in seconds. When set to a non-zero
	  value, this acts as a cap on the SOC off duration regardless of the requested
	  idle time. This is useful for periodically waking up to service the PMU watchdog
	  when using non-timer based wakeup sources (LPCOMP, GPIO). When set to 0 (default),
	  no maximum duration limit is applied.
