            Controls the VBAT(LI) brownout threshold.
            For VBAT level <= 1.8V,
                VBAT threshold = 0.9 + 0.025X, where 0 <= X <= 31
            For VBAT level > 1.8V,
                VBAT threshold = 1.4 + 0.05X, where
                    0 <= X <= 31, for non-rechargeable battery type
                    0 <= X <= 17, for rechargeable battery type
	    For VBATLI,
		VBATLI threshold = 2.4V + 0.050X, where 2 <= X <= 31
            The battery level is specified through OTP and is equal to BATT_LEVEL_GT_1P8V by default. It can be overwritten through CONFIG_BATT_LEVEL. Refer to the PMU configuration for additional details.
