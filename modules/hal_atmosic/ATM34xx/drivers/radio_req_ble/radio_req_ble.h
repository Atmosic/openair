 *
 * This driver handles request for BLE radio operations. It will coordinate
 * with the Radio Manager and the BLE HAL to ensure that operations occur when
 * possible, and will return an error when that is not possible. When calling
 * the BLE Request Driver, all calls should go here, and no calls should go
 * directly to the BLE HAL directly.
