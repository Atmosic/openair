config RETAINED_MEM_TEST_HIBERNATION_DURATION_MS
	int "Hibernation duration for tests in milliseconds"
	default 2000
	help
	  Duration in milliseconds for hibernation during tests.
	  Longer durations provide more realistic testing but increase
	  test execution time.

config RETAINED_MEM_TEST_LOG_LEVEL
	int "Log level for retained memory tests"
	default 4
	range 0 4
	help
	  Sets the log level for retained memory test module.
	  Levels: 0=OFF, 1=ERR, 2=WRN, 3=INF, 4=DBG
	  Use 4 (DBG) for detailed debug output including data patterns,
	  checksums, and hibernation status. Use 3 (INF) for normal output.
