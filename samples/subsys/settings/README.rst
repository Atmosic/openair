.. _atm_settings:

Atmosic Settings Subsystem
###############

Overview
********

Application demonstrating how to load key-value pairs from factory data and
settings storage partitions, and save key-value pairs to settings storage
partition with the atm_settings related functions.

Building and Running
********************

This sample relies on building the settings subsystem with `CONFIG_SETTINGS=y`
and `CONFIG_ATM_SETTINGS=y` which will compile settings and atm_settings related
functions for the application to access factory data and settings storage.
Before running the application, the factory data and settings storage bin files
must be programmed. These bin files are generated by ZSG Tool based on the yml
files in the tag_data folder.
