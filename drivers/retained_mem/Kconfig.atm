	  Enable driver for Atmosic hibernation retained memory support.
	  This driver uses SHUB (Sensor Hub) registers and PSEQ (Power Sequencer)
	  persistent registers to provide retained memory functionality across
	  hibernation and low power modes.

	  The driver automatically determines storage capacity based on SOC variant:
	  - With PERSISTENT6: 222 bytes
	  - With PERSISTENT5: 218 bytes
	  - Base configuration: 198 bytes

	  Note: This driver cannot be used when SHUB is enabled for sensor
	  functionality as it conflicts with the register usage.

config ATM_SHUB_ENABLED
	bool "Atmosic Sensor Hub (SHUB) functionality enabled"
	help
	  This option indicates that the Atmosic Sensor Hub (SHUB) hardware
	  is being used for sensor functionality. When enabled, it prevents
	  the retained memory driver from using SHUB registers, as they
	  conflict with sensor operations.

	  Enable this option if:
	  - Using SHUB for sensor data collection
	  - Running sensor hub firmware
	  - Using any sensor drivers that require SHUB hardware

	  When this option is enabled, the retained memory driver will be
	  automatically disabled to prevent register conflicts.
