  Atmosic hibernation retained memory driver.

  This driver provides retained memory functionality using Atmosic SOC's
  SHUB (Sensor Hub) registers and PSEQ (Power Sequencer) persistent registers
  that retain their values during hibernation and low power modes.

  The driver automatically determines the available storage capacity based on
  the SOC variant:
  - With PERSISTENT6: 222 bytes
  - With PERSISTENT5: 218 bytes
  - Base configuration: 198 bytes

  Example usage:

  retained_mem_hib: retained-memory {
    compatible = "atmosic,retained-hib";
    status = "okay";
  };

compatible: "atmosic,retained-hib"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  status:
    default: "okay"
