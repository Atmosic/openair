    The Atmosic pin controller is a node used for configuring pin selections
    and related properties such as pull-up and pull-down.

    You can modify this node by using the 'pinctrl' node label in the boards
    devictree as shown below:

      &pinctrl {
        /* Pin configuration */
      };

    Each pin that makes up a pin configuration should be a child node of the
    pinctrl node. These child nodes contain a 'pinmux' element which is a
    2-element array of the pin number, and the signal for the pin. They may
    optionally have pull-up and pull-down information added as well. An example
    for I2C is shown below.

      /* include signal macros */
      #include <atm33_pinmux.h>

      &pinctrl {
        i2c1_sda_default: i2c1_sda_default {
            /* configure P7 as I2C1 SDA with pull-up
            pinmux = <7 PINMUX_I2C1_SDA>;
            bias-pull-up;
        };

        i2c1_scl_default: i2c1_scl_default {
            /* configure P6 as I2C1 SCL */
            pinmux = <6 PINMUX_I2C1_SCL>;
        };
      };


    The above node defines a configuration called 'i2c1_sda_default' which
    configures P7 as I2C1 SDA with a pull-up and 'i2c1_scl_default' which
    condigures P6 as I2C1 SCL. Finally a peripheral can use this configuration
    by adding a pinctrl-N and pinctrl-names property to the peripherals node.
    An example is as follows:

      &i2c1 {
        ...
        pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_sda_default &i2c1_scl_default>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        ...
      };

    Each pin configuration for a specific peripheral should have its own
    "pinctrl-N" with a unique number, starting with 0, however numbers are
    expected to be reset and be reused between different peripherals. Typically
    only a 'pinctrl-0' is necessary. The names for each configuration should be
    comma seperated.

          Each pinmux entry should be an array of two values, the first value
          is the pin, and the second value is the signal it should be configured
          to.
