    The Atmosic pin controller is a node used for configuring pin selections
    and related properties such as pull-up and pull-down.

    You can modify this node by using the 'pinctrl' node label in the boards
    devictree as shown below:

      &pinctrl {
        /* Pin configuration */
      };

    Each pin that makes up a pin configuration should be a child node of the
    pinctrl node. These child nodes contain a 'pinmux' element which is a
    2-element array of the pin number, and the signal for the pin. They may
    optionally have pull-up and pull-down information added as well. An example
    for I2C is shown below.

      /* include signal macros */
      #include <atm34_pinmux.h>

      &pinctrl {
        i2c1_sda_default: i2c1_sda_default {
            /* configure P7 as I2C1 SDA with pull-up
            pinmux = <7 PINMUX_I2C1_SDA>;
            bias-pull-up;
        };

        i2c1_scl_default: i2c1_scl_default {
            /* configure P6 as I2C1 SCL */
            pinmux = <6 PINMUX_I2C1_SCL>;
        };
      };


    The above node defines a configuration called 'i2c1_sda_default' which
    configures P7 as I2C1 SDA with a pull-up and 'i2c1_scl_default' which
    condigures P6 as I2C1 SCL. Finally a peripheral can use this configuration
    by adding a pinctrl-N and pinctrl-names property to the peripherals node.
    An example is as follows:

      &i2c1 {
        ...
        pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_sda_default &i2c1_scl_default>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        ...
      };

    Each pin configuration for a specific peripheral should have its own
    "pinctrl-N" with a unique number, starting with 0, however numbers are
    expected to be reset and be reused between different peripherals. Typically
    only a 'pinctrl-0' is necessary. The names for each configuration should be
    comma seperated.
